# FitBeat: Gamified_Fitness_Platform
Creating a Gamified fitness platform in order to help the user enjoy games and maintain good health at the same time.  Our project idea is to provide a fitness experience that is gamified (applying gaming principles, game design techniques, and game mechanics to applications in order to improve clinical outcomes).

**# Problem statement:**

The pervasive use of video games and smartphones in contemporary society has contributed to the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle across all age groups. The demanding nature of modern schedules leaves individuals, particularly children, with insufficient time for engaging in physical activities. Consequently, a growing number of people are experiencing a decline in physical fitness due to reduced opportunities for exercise. This can lead to both physical as well as mental diseases. This leads to some adverse consequences such as weakening of muscles and thus proves to be a poor resort to enjoyment. Ultimately, this unhealthy trend adversely impacts individuals’ overall health, calling for urgent attention and remedial actions.

**# Objective and Solution:**

We have planned to create a gamified fitness platform in order to help the user enjoy games and maintain good health at the same time.

Our project idea is to provide a fitness experience that is gamified (applying gaming principles, game design techniques, and game mechanics to applications in order to improve clinical outcomes).

We will mainly implement our project in python using machine learning. The game would require users to run and jump as well as do physical exercises in real life in order for their avatar in the game to imitate the motion and move on the screen.

*# Other Features:*

To motivate the users, we are planning to give rewards on multiple levels. Also, the users will have to earn a fixed number of rewards each day/week to fulfil their daily and weekly goals along with some fun challenges mentioned. For example, we can activate the lives to play the game only after the user performs some fitness moves.

There will be a warm up page. After reaching this page, the user would be guided to perform some number of exercises using a voice bot and some visuals. Only after the user is successful in performing the actions, will he/she be able to unlock the gaming page.

There will be a health page containing famous blogs and links to famous and most trusted youtubers (like fit tuber).

A Calorie counter which will tell the number of calories lost while playing the game.

Different game levels – Easy, medium, hard.

So, the overall motive is to combine fitness with fun.

**# How is this Different?**

There is no other web application that analyses live video and transforms the physical experience of exercising and working out into entertaining activities.

Enhanced Gaming Experience: This platform provides users with a complete gaming experience while incorporating physical activity. By combining exercise and gameplay, users can enjoy immersive and interactive experiences that make fitness more enjoyable and engaging, ultimately tackling the problems of laziness and obesity associated with sedentary lifestyles.

Motivating through rewards: Have multiple rewards like Points and Badges to showcase Achievements with multiple challenges along the way.

Easy to use interface: The interface design will focus on providing a positive user experience, ensuring that users can quickly and efficiently engage in exercise-based gaming activities.

**# Tech Stack:**

Step1: Model creation: We will use Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning for training our model and capturing real time gestures. We will use different libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCv for this purpose.

Step2: Implementing the model: We will create a game to implement our model which will be integrated with our python model.

For the website, we will use Flutter.

**# Future Scope:**

With growing concerns about health and the addictive nature of games, we need a solution that incorporates both enjoyment and health. The use of video and mobile games has skyrocketed, wreaking havoc on people’s health. So, we can confidently state that this application has a bright future ahead of it and a noble goal of getting people back in shape.

**# Target Audience:**

The web application targets gamers, fitness enthusiasts, health-conscious individuals, and those with limited time for exercise, offering a unique blend of entertainment and physical activity. It caters to individuals of all age groups, providing a convenient and engaging solution to combat sedentary lifestyles and promote active living.
